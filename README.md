# PHP OOP 2

## Setup
I suggest to open a local server using **MAMP** to open ```index.php```.

## Description
This exercise is a continuation of [the first oop exercise](https://github.com/Obez99/php-oop-1), this one introduces the concepts of **Sub-Classes**, **Protected and Private variables** and **Traits**.
<br>
This is the recreation of an online shop using **Object Oriented Programming**.<br>
**The classes and sub-classes I created are**:<br>
- **User**
  - PremiumUser
- **Product**
- **CreditCard**
  - CreditCardTrait (Trait)
- **Cart**

Each user can add products in their cart and credit cards.<br>
If the user has the PremiumUser class gets a premium discount.

(**The credit card information is obviously fake**)
